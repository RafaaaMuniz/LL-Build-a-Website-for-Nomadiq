# 🌐 LiveLab: Responsive Website

In this lab, you’ll build a responsive website while exploring how AI-assisted tools (Copilot & ChatGPT) can help with layout, design choices, and accessibility.  

You’ll create a **travel-themed site** for *Nomadiq Travel Destinations*. You should primarily:  
- **Work in GitHub Codespaces with Copilot** – this is your main environment for saving code in a repo and expanding your project.  

You also have the option to:  
- **Work in ChatGPT (Canvas)** – prompt, preview, and edit code directly. If you choose this route, you can later copy your code into **Codespaces** to save it to a repo and continue building with Copilot.
